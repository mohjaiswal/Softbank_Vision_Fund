### Overview of SoftBank Vision Fund 1 and 2
SoftBank Vision Fund, a subsidiary of the SoftBank Group, is a key investor in various sectors including internet-of-things, artificial intelligence, robotics, communications, computational biology, cloud technologies, e-commerce, fintechs, and more. The goal is to invest in businesses and platforms believed to revolutionize tomorrow's world.

#### SoftBank Vision Fund 1 
Launched in 2017 with a massive $100 billion corpus, it saw SoftBank as an anchor investor alongside major players from West Asia and tech giants like Apple. The fund adopted an aggressive late-stage investing strategy, although it faced challenges in fund deployment and exits.

#### SoftBank Vision Fund 2
In 2019, Masayoshi Son launched SVF 2, which was about 40% the size of its predecessor. The distinct approach of SVF 2 involved a higher number of investments but with less concentration in each, differing significantly from SVF 1.

### The Current Scenario
Both funds are currently underperforming. Amidst a general downturn in public markets, a significant portion of the 349 companies invested in by these funds were downgraded last quarter. This decline, primarily in private companies, highlights potential overestimations in performance and valuations.

The strategy of issuing large checks under the assumption of mature valuations has not yielded the short-term gains anticipated, leaving the funds vulnerable to market corrections.

## Analyzing the Results

A closer look at SVF 1 shows a 26% decrease on its $32.5 billion investment cost. Despite significant investments in companies like Paytm, only a few have proved profitable for SVF 1. The losses in some investments, like DiDi Global, have been substantial, overshadowing gains in others.

Note: SoftBank's financial year runs from April to March (as shown in Figure 1.3).

## Why This Matters

As SoftBank Vision Funds strive to recover their reputation and performance, they are dependent on an upturn in public market sentiments. Their success hinges on the business growth and profitability of their investee companies and the potential monetization of these investments through stock market listings, either via IPOs or SPACs.

Of the 42 public listings from SVF companies, most were in 2021, with a mix of IPOs and SPACs. However, the current economic climate, marked by interest rate hikes and tightened fund flows, poses challenges, especially for the large-scale investments made by the funds.

## Looking Ahead

Masayoshi Son is contemplating radical changes, not just in investment strategies but also in personnel and cost structures, to navigate through these challenging economic times.
